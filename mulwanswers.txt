  ANS-B


7.Question 2
When designing an upstream API and its implementation, the development team has been advised to not set timeouts when invoking downstream API. Because the downstream API has no SLA that can be relied upon. This is the only donwstream API dependency of that upstream API. Assume the downstream API runs uninterrupted without crashing. What is the impact of this advice?  (C)
 AThe invocation of the downstream API will run to completion without timing out.

 BAn SLA for the upstream API CANNOT be provided.

 CA default timeout of 500 ms will automatically be applied by the Mule runtime in which the upstream API implementation executes.

 DA load-dependent timeout of less than 1000 ms will be applied by the Mule runtime in which the downstream API implementation executes.

ANS-C



8.Question 3
An API has been updated in Anypoint Exchange by its API producer from version 3.1.1 to 3.2.0 following accepted semantic versioning practices and the changes have been communicated via the API's public portal. The API endpoint does NOT change in the new version. How should the developer of an API client respond to this change?  (D)
 AThe update should be identified as a project risk and full regression testing of the functionality that uses this API should be run.

 BThe API producer should be contacted to understand the change to existing functionality.

 CThe API producer should be requested to run the old version in parallel with the new one.

 DThe API client code ONLY needs to be changed if it needs to take advantage of new features.

 ANS-D


9.Question 4
A new upstream API Is being designed to offer an SLA of 500 ms median and 800 ms maximum (99th percentile) response time. The corresponding API implementation needs to sequentially invoke 3 downstream APIs of very similar complexity. The first of these downstream APIs offers the following SLA for its response time: median: 100 ms, 80th percentile: 500 ms, 95th percentile: 1000 ms. If possible, how can a timeout be set in the upstream API for the invocation of the first downstream API to meet the new upstream API's desired SLA?  (A)
 ASet a timeout of 100 ms; that leaves 400 ms for the other two downstream APIs to complete

 BDo not set a timeout; the Invocation of this API Is mandatory and so we must wait until it responds

 CSet a timeout of 50 ms; this times out more invocations of that API but gives additional room for retries

 DNo timeout is possible to meet the upstream API's desired SLA; a different SLA must be negotiated with the first downstream API or invoke an alternative API

ANS-A

What type of restrictions exist on the types of certificates for the service that can be exposed by the CloudHub Shared Load Balancer (SLB) to external web clients over the public internet?   (B)

 BOnly MuleSoft provided certificates can be used for server side certificate

 COnly self signed certificates can be used

Q112.
When designing an upstream API and its implementation, the development team has been advised to not set timeouts when invoking downstream API. Because the downstream API has no SLA that can be relied upon. This is the only donwstream API dependency of that upstream API. Assume the downstream API runs uninterrupted without crashing. What is the impact of this advice?
ANS: A default timeout of 500 ms will automatically be applied by the Mule runtime in which the upstream API implementation executes.
Q113.
An API has been updated in Anypoint Exchange by its API producer from version 3.1.1 to 3.2.0 following accepted semantic versioning practices and the changes have been communicated via the API's public portal. The API endpoint does NOT change in the new version. How should the developer of an API client respond to this change?
ANS: The API client code ONLY needs to be changed if it needs to take advantage of new features.
Q114.
A new upstream API Is being designed to offer an SLA of 500 ms median and 800 ms maximum (99th percentile) response time. The corresponding API implementation needs to sequentially invoke 3 downstream APIs of very similar complexity. The first of these downstream APIs offers the following SLA for its response time: median: 100 ms, 80th percentile: 500 ms, 95th percentile: 1000 ms. If possible, how can a timeout be set in the upstream API for the invocation of the first downstream API to meet the new upstream API's desired SLA?
ANS: No timeout is possible to meet the upstream API's desired SLA; a different SLA must be negotiated with the first downstream API or invoke an alternative API
Q115.
An organization has several APIs that accept JSON data over HTTP POST. The APIs are all publicly available and are associated with several mobile applications and web applications.
